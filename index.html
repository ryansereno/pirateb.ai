      <h2> We now possess the power to bring the modern advertising industry to its knees. </h2>
      <p> The future of ad blocking is beyond browser plugins. </p>
      <p>It will be an intelligent control layer for all media that enters your home. </p>

        Browser api's are too restrictive to allow for nuanced control over what content
        you are exposed to. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Modern advertising is increasingly subtle, manipulative, and natively embedded into apps.
        <br />
        <br />
        AI based ad blocking operates at the OS level, not just controlling http requests like current blockers, but
        also intelligently muting audio, hiding images, and blocking embedded content.
